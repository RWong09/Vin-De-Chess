Vin De Chess 🐎♟️

Vin de Chess is a chess game made by a data science student from University of Malaya, Wong Hoong Liang.

It’s a fun chess project that not only lets you grind chess but also lets you take a break by looking at chess memes (especially when you lose 200 Elo, if you have more than that 😆).

✨ Features

🎨 Customization: Change the design of pieces and boards (add your own designs too!).

🧩 Custom Positions: Create and study valid chess positions to improve your game.

😂 Chess Memes: Enjoy memes with descriptions to lighten the mood.

🚀 How to Run

Update the paths for:

Logo

Chess piece images

Board images

⚠️ For chess and board images, make sure you only copy the chess pieces and board file paths, as the game loads them directly from the code.

Update the memes_dir path just like in step 1.

Save the setup file as:

Chess_Setup.py


Run the game from:

Chess_Game.py


Troubleshoot if needed, but do not change the whole structure or code parts unless the root problem is algorithm-related.

🎉 You’re good to go! Time to get your GM title 👑

📌 Notes

Built with Python (pygame).

Best experienced with your own custom chess designs.
