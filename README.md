# Vin De Chess 🐎♟️

Vin de Chess is a chess game made by a data science student from University of Malaya, Wong Hoong Liang.

It’s a fun chess project that not only lets you grind chess but also lets you take a break by looking at chess memes 
(especially when you lose 200 Elo, if you have more than that 😆).

# ✨ Features

- 🎨 Customization: Change the design of pieces and boards (add your own designs too!).
- 🧩 Custom Positions: Create and study valid chess positions to improve your game.
- 😂 Chess Memes: Enjoy memes with descriptions to lighten the mood.
- 🤸‍♂️ Freestyle Chess: Yes! Chess960 aka Freestyle Chess is available in Vin De Chess!


# 🚀 How to Run

1. Update the paths for:
   - Logo
   - Chess piece images
   - Board images

   ⚠️ For chess and board images, make sure you only copy the chess pieces and board file paths, 
   as the game loads them directly from the code.

2. Update the `memes_dir` path just like in step 1.

3. Save the setup file as:
   Chess_Setup.py

4. Run the game from:
   Chess_Game.py

   - Troubleshoot if needed, but do not change the whole structure or code parts unless the root problem is algorithm-related.

5. 🎉 You’re good to go! Time to get your GM title 👑


# 📌 Notes

- Built with Python (Pygame).
- Best experienced with your own custom chess designs.
